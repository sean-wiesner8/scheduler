# Scheduler
A general schedule creator for a high school or a school with a similar structure. Created using Java.

## Running the Program
In order to create a schedule with sample inputs, simply execute Main.java. In order to create a schedule with your own inputs, edit the inputs in Main.java to create your custom schedule. The parameters are set by instantiating an Organizer object, and the schedule is created by calling the solve method. 

# Program Information
**:Purpose:**
My high school had a two week period of no classes during which our physics teacher would spend all of his time creating a schedule to fit everyone's needs. While I will not send him this repository as I believe he enjoys creating the schedules, this program automates the process of organizing courses into time slots based on parameters such as student course enrollments and course credit amounts.

**:Schedule Layout:**
While my high school worked on a 6 period per day, 5 day per cycle layout, this program can organize a schedule with any number of periods per day and days per cycle.
